"""
Initial thoughts from Rick T:
    - creating anonymity is the goal
    - middleware could act as a hashtable with initialized buckets 'n' for number of zips
        - key: zipcode
        - value: weather stats
    - Publisher script calls into middleware hashtable to update value using ziptable[zip] = collected_weather
    - Subscriber script polls value from middleware using ziptable[zip] or ziptable.get(zip)

    - this allows for neither the client/server knowing the pub/sub servers
